  Remember Zoë Quinn? If not, let me jog your memory. Quinn is a video game
  developer, who was forced out of her home after she was hit time and time
  again with harassing comments. In the same month, an openly feminist critic
  and commentator, Anita Sarkeesian, was also forced out of her home after
  internet trolls continuously sent threatening messages and misogynistic
  messages to her.
